# Python Office Automation in Practice: A Powerful Tool for Improving Work Efficiency

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced work environment, improving office efficiency has become increasingly important. Python, as a simple yet powerful programming language, plays an increasingly vital role in office automation. This article introduces several practical Python office automation cases to help readers master how to use Python to improve work efficiency. Whether you're a data analyst, administrative staff, or regular office worker, these cases can help you save significant time on repetitive tasks.

## Practical Cases

### 1. Excel Data Processing Automation

#### Use Case
In daily work, we often need to process large amounts of Excel data, such as data cleaning, format conversion, and data statistics. Python can easily automate these tasks.

#### Code Implementation
```python
import pandas as pd
import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles import PatternFill, Font

def process_excel_data(input_file, output_file):
    # Read Excel file
    df = pd.read_excel(input_file)
    
    # Data cleaning
    df = df.dropna()  # Remove null values
    df = df.drop_duplicates()  # Remove duplicates
    
    # Data statistics
    summary = df.describe()
    
    # Save processed data
    with pd.ExcelWriter(output_file) as writer:
        df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Processed Data', index=False)
        summary.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Statistics')
    
    # Beautify Excel
    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(output_file)
    ws = wb['Processed Data']
    
    # Set header style
    header_fill = PatternFill(start_color='366092', end_color='366092', fill_type='solid')
    header_font = Font(color='FFFFFF', bold=True)
    
    for cell in ws[1]:
        cell.fill = header_fill
        cell.font = header_font
    
    wb.save(output_file)

# Usage example
process_excel_data('raw_data.xlsx', 'processed_data.xlsx')
```

### 2. Automated Email Sending

#### Use Case
Regularly sending reports, notifications, or bulk personalized emails is a common requirement in many work scenarios. Python can easily automate email sending.

#### Code Implementation
```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.application import MIMEApplication
import pandas as pd

def send_automated_email(sender_email, sender_password, recipient_email, subject, body, attachment_path=None):
    # Create email object
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = recipient_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    
    # Add email body
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'html'))
    
    # Add attachment
    if attachment_path:
        with open(attachment_path, 'rb') as f:
            attachment = MIMEApplication(f.read())
            attachment.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename=attachment_path)
            msg.attach(attachment)
    
    # Send email
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
        server.send_message(msg)
        server.quit()
        print(f"Email successfully sent to {recipient_email}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending email: {str(e)}")

# Bulk email sending example
def send_bulk_emails(sender_email, sender_password, recipients_file):
    # Read recipient information
    df = pd.read_excel(recipients_file)
    
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        recipient_email = row['email']
        name = row['name']
        
        # Personalized email content
        subject = f"Hello {name}! Your Weekly Report"
        body = f"""
        <html>
            <body>
                <h2>Dear {name},</h2>
                <p>Please find your weekly report attached.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Best regards,</p>
            </body>
        </html>
        """
        
        send_automated_email(
            sender_email,
            sender_password,
            recipient_email,
            subject,
            body,
            f"reports/{name}_report.pdf"
        )
```

### 3. Batch File Processing

#### Use Case
In daily work, we often need to perform operations such as renaming and format conversion on large numbers of files. Python can easily automate these tasks.

#### Code Implementation
```python
import os
import shutil
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

def batch_process_files(input_dir, output_dir, file_type='.xlsx'):
    # Create output directory
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Get all files of specified type
    files = list(Path(input_dir).glob(f'*{file_type}'))
    
    # Process each file
    for file in files:
        # Read file
        df = pd.read_excel(file)
        
        # Data processing (example: add processing date column)
        df['Processing Date'] = pd.Timestamp.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        
        # Save processed file
        output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, f'processed_{file.name}')
        df.to_excel(output_file, index=False)
        
        print(f"Processed file: {file.name}")

# Usage example
batch_process_files('raw_files', 'processed_files')
```

## Efficiency Comparison

Below is a comparison of manual processing versus automated processing times:

| Task Type | Manual Processing Time | Automated Processing Time | Efficiency Improvement |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Excel Data Processing | 2 hours | 5 minutes | 96% |
| Email Sending | 1 hour | 2 minutes | 97% |
| Batch File Processing | 3 hours | 10 minutes | 94% |

## Summary

Through the above cases, we can see the powerful role of Python in office automation. It not only helps us save significant time on repetitive tasks but also improves work accuracy and consistency. Readers are encouraged to choose appropriate automation solutions based on their work needs to gradually improve work efficiency.
