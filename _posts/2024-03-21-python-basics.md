# Python Basics: From Beginner to Pro

## Introduction
Python, as a simple yet powerful programming language, has become one of the most popular programming languages. This article will guide you through learning Python from scratch and mastering its fundamentals.

## Python Basic Syntax

### 1. Variables and Data Types
Basic data types in Python include:
- Integer (int)
- Floating-point number (float)
- String (str)
- Boolean (bool)
- List (list)
- Tuple (tuple)
- Dictionary (dict)

### 2. Control Flow
Python provides rich control flow statements:
- if-elif-else conditional statements
- for loops
- while loops
- break and continue statements

### 3. Function Definition
Defining and using functions in Python is straightforward:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Practice Exercise
Let's practice Python basic syntax with a simple example:

```python
# Calculate Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
    return fib

# Test the function
print(fibonacci(10))
```
